In the surreal universe of the Crisis Committee, a conglomerate of sentient rubber ducks dressed in astronaut suits held their annual "Quacknauts Symposium." This symposium brought together crisis experts, including alarmist lizards and melodramatic sock puppets, to discuss the pressing matters of the day, such as the impending invasion of cotton candy clouds and the shortage of marshmallow lifeboats. The symposium featured heated debates, with rubber ducks employing passionate quacks to make their points, while the sock puppets dramatically unfurled miniature banners with slogans like "Socks of Justice" and "Fluff or Bust."

During the symposium's intermission, a renegade group of rogue paper airplanes, representing the Crisis Committee's anti-gravity faction, attempted to stage a coup by folding themselves into origami swans and attempting to quack their way to the microphone. The crisis was averted by a coalition of sentient alarm clocks, who orchestrated an impromptu "Time's Up" musical performance, serenading the paper airplanes into a peaceful slumber, thus ending the Crisis Committee's most bizarre chapter yet.
