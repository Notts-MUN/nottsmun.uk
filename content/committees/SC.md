      bio: "My name is Aamir. I am a History student at the University of Nottingham.
I enjoy debating current affairs and geo-politics. I enjoy travelling because of the insight it provides into other cultures. 

My favourite aspect of MUN is the diverse people and opinions that it attracts.
MUN is a society that allows for dialouge and debate and that is what makes it special."

      bio: "I am Prathu, a computer science student at the University of Nottingham. I've been passionate about MUNs since my high school days, particularly in Security Council. This committee demands delegates to be of the highest calibre, to be quick and precise in their thinking to tackle some of the most critical issues in the world. As a Chair, I envision creating a stimulating yet welcoming environment where delegates engage in high-level debates, and enjoy their MUN experience."
