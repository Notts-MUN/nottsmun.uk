# About NOTTSMUN

The NOTTSMUN conference is ran by the United Nations Society from the University of Nottingham. In the 2010s the conference would be attended by more than 200 participants every year. However, NOTTSMUN, just like many other conferences and events, was cancelled due to the COVID 19 pandemic and it remained inactive in the years 2020-2022. It was not until March 2023, that a group of brave MUN-loving students, with not much conference-organizing experience brought NOTTSMUN back.

Our now annual conference takes place in Nottingham Park University in March. 

Our aim is to be a small conference that brings together students from all across the UK and that offers opportunities for both new and experienced delegates. We want to run relatively small committees, that allow the chairs to give detailed, personalized feedback to each and every delegate. NOTTSMUN focuses on collaboration and finding solutions through dialog and to that aim we wish to create inclusive and welcoming spaces where everyone can be heard.
