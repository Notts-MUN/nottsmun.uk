        We are beyond excited to welcome you back to Nottingham for the second edition of NOTTSMUN!  We have listened to your feedback from last year and implemented it into every stage of planning for <b>NOTTSMUN 2024</b>. This year we aim to go bigger and exceed your expectations at every level!

    <p>
        <b>NOTTSMUN  2024</b> will include five committees: <a href="/committees/disec">DISEC</a>, <a href="/committees/sochum">SOCHUM</a>, <a href="/committees/sc">SC</a>, <a href="/committees/cop">COP</a> and <a href="/committees/crisis">Crisis</a>. Just as last year, we will offer free tea and coffee to all the attendees. Prepare yourself for three exciting conference days with two socials and an unforgettable closing ceremony.

        The theme for this year is “building bridges”. We want to focus on connections between people, on international cooperation and on the importance of staying connected and maintaining diplomatic dialogue.

        The event will take place in <b>University Park Campus</b>, from the <b>15th of March to the 17th of March</b>. Don't wait! Build your metaphorical bridge to us by submitting your application and joining our conference as a chair, crisis director or delegate.

    <h1>Committees</h1>
    <p>
        This is a sentence which is placed here to say something about the following images. Unfortunately, that sentence failed to realise its purpose, and as a result the next sentence must suffice. The images below refer, pictorially, to the committees. Fortunately, they are placed atop corresponding titles for those not versed in committee logograms. In actual fact, these sentences, while logical, are purely for the purposes of filling this gap on the page.
